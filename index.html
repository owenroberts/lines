2.3.2020
- lots of issues with layers ui, repeated layers, missing layers, selecting, adding more frames
	- deleted layers not removed
	- adding and removing drawings all fucked up
- insert with the current stuff
- width of layers doesnt change
- key command for copy next paste
- clicking layer moves frame to beginning of layer if not already
- layer saved with debug color ...
- highlight layers in frame

2.10.2020
- changing framerate somehow fucked up the layers
- maybe dont use update AT ALLLLLL
- lineWidth STILL didn't load!

3.3.2020
- edit layer parameters like tween parameters ...
- use scrollbar for layers ... 
	- with different zooms, scroll wheel
	- timeline + layers
	- double click for edit?
- ui number element

after cssF
- "masonry" layout
- still unclear on what is module vs ui
	- ui have their own panel so they need to have 'ui' as module
	- loaded with interface, panels don't work until after load (like modules)
- try a js bundler or es6 modules again
	- alias could be useful for app/lns/edi
- ah fuck should i really rewrite modules as class?
- toggle changing size is annoying
- consolidate lines.js with setup.js
- even draw is a panel ??? - panels are multiple panel sections
- fancy frame scrolling ? prob not worth the time
- headless doesn't really work when they're not block
- layer saving probably need better props, not clean
- ui - technically don't even need this.mouseInterval ... that's dangerous?
- fromModule vs callback - save 100 lines of interface.json, vs rewriting and using if statements

- splitting or cloning multiple layers, tweens
	- meta layers?


- thinkers
	- rndr object in layer { r, n, w, v } ... xy?
	- blender like window system????
	- better layer highlighting?
	- editor own directory
	- range class?

- possible features
	- change onion skin color
	- option to loop back to beginning of frames, option to stop at end, option not to create frames beyond last frame
	- center lines canvas in larger area
	- set panel order more sophisticated - live with the idiosyncracy for now ... 
	- range slider for offset ? 

- game notes
	- item has text label, is that just relevant to idtio?
	- interactive extends items to play "interact state"
	- character 
	- scenes - dont need this to be a default, nice to have seperate from game or can extend game
		- unless there's a scene class?
		- scene change sound - used to stop start sound in idtio, could be sfx ...
		- scene change could be Game function
	- sound generally
		- toggle sound
	- loading module???
		- load ui, map
	- user class or module

- game thoughts 
	- animation class doesn't automatically load src, maybe need protocol for this
	- combine loaded json and file
	- canvas.getContext - still necessary?

- ios safari
	- un focus buttons - not focus, hover - worry about this later ...
	- touch event type, stylus or direct
	- hidable menu
	- custom menu with added buttons that are large
	- mobile styles use Cool.mobilecheck

	- saving files with names/extension - ios issue
	- always airdrop - not doable

- vsc to dos
	- game
		- loading doesn't wait for sprites to actually load
			- sprites jump on load

	- game editor 
		- fill page with game, floating ui?
		- empty lines filling up tool menus
		- double select all items
		- click to locate item from game to editor
		- too many textures in panel
			- collapsible hierarcy ie unity
		- key command to "add" texture - better word for texture?
	- animate
		- frame number switches when switching tabs (number key commands)
		- capture seconds of videos
		- reset defaults error / palette error
		- item/texture edit go to frame number
		- drawing that doesnt have layer ...
		- edit palette
		- custom ui panel
		- video capture countdown
		- saving empty layers .. ?


todo/interesting
- item window for game
- collapsible hierarchy for game
	- hide textures, items, or instances
	- groups?
- ui layouts for layers
- game/editor delayed loading
- game item/class render toggle
